that simulates a dinosaur auction system with transaction orders. The project is developed using Spring Boot, Maven, and H2 database.

## Technologies Used

- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- RESTful API
- MS (Java Message Service)
- Apache ActiveMQ (JMS provider)
- Swagger (API documentation)
- Spring Security

## Getting Started
Please check the [Help Guide](HELP.md) for detailed instructions on how to install and run the application.


## Configuration

The DinoAuction application is pre-configured with default settings for the H2 database and JMS integration with Apache ActiveMQ. 
However, if you need to modify the configuration, you can do so in the application.yml file located in the src/main/resources directory.

Ensure that you update the JMS connection details in the configuration file to match your Apache ActiveMQ installation.

## API Documentation

The DinoAuction application utilizes Swagger for API documentation. 
The API documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
